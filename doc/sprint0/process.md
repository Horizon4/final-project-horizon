Team Organization
  
  For sprint 0, we split it up into 7 tasks so that for each member of the group has a role to do for sprint 0. 
  
Decision Making
  
  
  
Prioritizing User Stories

  To prioritize user stories, we all met up in person to listen to the user stories and each member decided on a scale of 1-10 how difficult each user story would be. 
  
Meetings

  We have decided to collectively meet weekly in person to address any questions or clarifications that may be needed. If an attendee is absent, that person would call in so that they may still be a part of the discussion. Other times, we would message each other using messenger and slack to schedule in person meetings, and to go over each other's parts.

Tools Used

 The tools we used for messaging each other were messenger and slack.

Next Phase
  
  For the next sprint, we need to improve how we go about scheduling meetings in person. Perhaps, using a scheduling system such as doodle, or each member checking off their availability.
