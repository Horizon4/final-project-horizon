## Decision Making

We made decisions through a lot of discussion in person and through messaging applications???

## Prioritizing User Stories

To prioritize user stories, we all met up in person to listen to the user stories and each member decided on a scale of 1-10 how much time would be spent on implementing the features that the user stories described. 

This took 2 rounds?

## Meetings

We have decided to collectively meet weekly in person to address any questions or clarifications that may be needed. If an attendee is absent, that person would call in so that they may still be a part of the discussion. Other times, we would message each other using messenger and slack to schedule in person meetings, and to go over each other's parts.

## Tools Used

The tools we used for messaging each other were messenger and slack.

## Next Phase

For the next sprint, we need to improve how we go about scheduling meetings in person. Perhaps, using a scheduling system such as doodle, or each member checking off their availability.
