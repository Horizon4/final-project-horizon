## Decision Making

We made decisions through a lot of discussion in person and through messaging applications. The majority of the time, we would meet up in person so that it is easier to discuss topics.

Several important decisions were made during this phase. 
1. We decided on the idea of the application after brainstorming a number of ideas and holding a vote (The core features of the app came through more discussion as well as a suggestion from the professor)
2. We decided on using the MEAN stack after some more experienced members suggested the idea to the rest of the group
3. We decided on using Messenger and Slack as they are easy ways to keep members up to date and notified

## Prioritizing User Stories

To prioritize user stories, we all met up in person to listen to the user stories and each member decided on a scale of 1-10 how much time would be spent on implementing the features that the user stories described. Since we were not able to complete it all, we decided to create a file that allowed us to put in the amount of points we think each user story deserves.

## Meetings

We have decided to collectively meet weekly in person to address any questions or clarifications that may be needed. If an attendee is absent, that person would call in so that they may still be a part of the discussion. Other times, we would message each other using messenger and slack to schedule in person meetings, and to go over each other's parts.

## Tools Used

The tools we used for messaging each other were messenger and slack. To design the layout of the web application, we used inkscape.

## Next Phase

For the next sprint, we need to improve how we go about scheduling meetings in person. Perhaps, using a scheduling system such as doodle, or each member checking off their availability. 

For the next phase we plan on producing a minimum viable product with the core features of our application. This would follow the same planning and organization process we held for this sprint. The first meeting for sprint 1 will solidify the plans for that sprint.
