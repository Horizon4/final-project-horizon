Meetings

  We have decided to collectively meet weekly in person to address any questions or clarifications that may be needed. If an attendee is absent, that person would call in so that they may still be a part of the discussion. Other times, we would message each other using messenger and slack to schedule in person meetings, and to go over each other's parts.
