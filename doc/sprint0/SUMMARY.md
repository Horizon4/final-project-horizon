# **Objective**:

Build a piece of software that creates an itinerary for a potential traveller after receiving a budget, starting location, locations to travel to, and duration of trip. Application will take in a budget, starting location, travel destination(s), departure date(s), and arrivale date(s).
 
 
# **Key Personas**: 

Michael Bordan - A fresh graduate who has just completed his bachelors in computer science.He became a tech-savvy individual who can fluently develop web and mobile applications but, cannot make decisions well and always needs help to arrive at one.

Peter Garret - Fourty-five-year-old father of three children. He works at the Hasbro toy company as a toy maker and likes to grab a drink with friends at the same Irish pub in the city.

Leo Thompson - Eighteen-year-old Leo Thompson is one of two children in a family of four people. He is very smart and does well in school, but is shy, has no motivation to do anything, and only has a couple of friends, Donny and Raph.

# **Key Scenarios**:

Michael Bordan doesn't know what he wants to do after graduation so his father suggested a vacation to clear up his mind, he went with it. However he doesn't have any plans of where to go and what to do where ever he decides to. He feels a vacation would definitely help him but, he needs suggestions to help him decide where to go.

Peter Garret has been planning for a vacation for 2 years and has most of his trip planned out already but, he noticed quite a few gaps on some days inbetween his events. He has room in his budget to add a couple more events to his itinerary but, doesn't know what else to add. 

Leo Thompson and his friends got a paid vacation from their parents as a present for graduating but, on the circumstance that they would come up with a suitable itinerary and present it to their parents for a review. Leo didn't want to make one but, came up short when he and his friends drew straws. He and his friends mostly want to visit the big tourist attractions and eat cultural food within their budget.

# **Key Principles**:
Customer Satisfaction over System Efficieny-The design should provide a seamless itinerary even if it incurs an expense or inefficieny in the flight system.

Customizable-The itinerary should allow the user to feel in control of all aspects of their own trip within reason.
