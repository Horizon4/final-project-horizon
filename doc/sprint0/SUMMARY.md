# **Key Personas**: 

Michael Bordan - A fresh graduate who has just completed his bachelors in computer science.He became a tech-savvy individual who can fluently develop web and mobile applications but, cannot make decisions well and always needs help to arrive at one.

Peter Garret - Fourty-five-year-old father of three children. He works at the Hasbro toy company as a toy maker and likes to grab a drink with friends at the same Irish pub in the city.

Leo Thompson - Eighteen-year-old Leo Thompson is one of two children in a family of four people. He is very smart and does well in school, but is shy, has no motivation to do anything, and only has a couple of friends, Donny and Raph.

# **Key Scenarios**:

Michael Bordan doesn't know what he wants to do after graduation so his father suggested a vacation to several countries in Europe like France, Rome, Germany and Sweden to clear up his mind, and he went with it. However he doesn't have any plans of where to go in those countries. He feels a vacation would definitely help him but, he needs suggestions to help him decide where to go and something within his budget of $2000.

Peter Garret has been planning for a vacation to 3 week Mozambique for 2 years and has most of his trip planned out already but, he noticed on his last day he doesn't really have any events to go to. He has $250 left in his budget of $5000 to add a couple more events to his itinerary but, doesn't know what else to add. 

Leo Thompson and his friends got a paid vacation of $1000 to Mexico for 5 days from their parents as a present for graduating but, on the circumstance that they would come up with a suitable itinerary and present it to their parents for a review. Leo didn't want to make one but, came up short when he and his friends drew straws. He and his friends mostly want to visit Coba, Chapultepec and the National Museum of Antrhopology and eat tacos.

# **Key Principles**:
Customer Satisfaction over System Efficieny-The design should provide a seamless itinerary even if it incurs an expense or inefficieny in the flight system.

Customizable-The itinerary should allow the user to feel in control of all aspects of their own trip within reason.
