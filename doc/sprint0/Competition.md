What will make our product different is that it will focus more on the trip building and planning aspect. Instead of just acting as a tool to book flights and hotels, it will create entire trip itineraries that plan out a suggested tour based on user inputs.

This product will be better for the specific users that know they want to travel with a budget, but arenâ€™t too sure about attractions and planning. The competitors seemed to focus more on providing an easy and convenient way for trips to be set up.
